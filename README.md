# AoT: Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling

![The overview of AoT](image/aot.png)

This is a lightweight, standalone implementation of the paper [Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12018). An implementation under the [MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT) (ICLR 2024 Oral) framework is also coming soon, which will be suitable for users familiar with that framework and its excellent open-source projects including but not limited to [AFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10762) (ICLR 2025 Oral).

While we have received several successful reproduction feedbacks, there might be potential issues we haven't caught yet. If you encounter any issues during implementation or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via email at <steamedbun2002@outlook.com>.

## üéØ What We Will Do Next

**Enhancing Reproducibility:**
We are continuously working to improve the reproducibility of this codebase. Following our commitment, we plan to implement this framework under MetaGPT, making it more accessible for users familiar with the ecosystem.

**Expanding Functionality:**
We are developing additional features including automatic optimization (more insights can be found in our previous works [AFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10762) and [SPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06855)) and support for custom datasets, aiming to make the framework more versatile and user-friendly.

**Advancing Atomic Reasoning:**
Atomic reasoning remains underexplored, yet vital. Can LLMs master slow, atomic reasoning in the same way that models like o1 and R1 have mastered long CoT reasoning? This question requires continuous exploration and investigation. We are committed to advancing this research direction and sharing our insights with the community as we progress.

## üìñ Overview

Atom of Thoughts (AoT) is a new reasoning framework that represents the solution as a composition of atomic questions. This approach transforms the reasoning process into a Markov process with atomic states, where state transitions use a two-phase mechanism: first decomposing the current question into a temporary dependency-based directed acyclic graph, then contracting its subquestions to form a new atomic question state. AoT significantly enhances large language models' performance on reasoning tasks while reducing computational waste. Additionally, these atomic states enable AoT to function as a plugin for existing test-time scaling methods, allowing for flexible integration that combines the strengths of different approaches.

**Key Features:**

- **General Reasoning Capability**: Works across diverse reasoning scenarios including math, multi-choice, and multi-hop QA with the same codebase, differentiated only by task-specific prompts
- **Plug-in Enhancement**: Can be integrated with existing test-time scaling methods to improve their performance
- **Resource Efficiency**: Focuses computational resources on effective reasoning rather than processing historical information
- **Superior Performance**: Outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks, enabling gpt-4o-mini to surpass o3-mini by 3.4% and DeepSeek-R1 by 10.6% on HotpotQA

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Configuration Setup

Before using the Atom of Thoughts (AoT) framework, you need to set up your API key and URL:

1. Create an `apikey.py` file in the project root directory with the following format:

```
url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Replace with your API endpoint
api_key = [
    "your-api-key-here",  # Replace with your actual API key
    # You can add multiple API keys to improve concurrency performance.
]
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Atom Mode: Using AoT as a reasoning method

Evaluate the performance of AoT on a specific dataset:

```bash
python main.py --dataset math --start 0 --end 10 --model gpt-4o-mini
```

### Command Arguments

- `--dataset`: Choose from `math`, `gsm8k`, `bbh`, `mmlu`, `hotpotqa`, or `longbench`
- `--start` and `--end`: Specify the range of examples to evaluate (e.g., 0-10 for first 10 examples)
- `--model`: Model name of the LLM to use
- `--mode`: Choose between `atom` (main experiment) or `plugin` (generate contracted dataset)

The `plugin` mode enables AoT to serve as a preprocessing step that generates contracted questions which can then be fed into other reasoning frameworks. This approach combines the benefits of AoT's atomic state representation with other test-time scaling methods, allowing the contracted questions to maintain answer equivalence with the original questions while eliminating unnecessary historical information.
